                <h1>Zachary Sloan</h1>
                <p>I am a student at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering. I have experience in C, Java, React, and html/css.
                    I also have experience with Linux operating systems. Throughout my time in college I have become more interested in
                    learning new skills in Software Development. I have worked hard on many projects to improve my knowledge in coding. These
                    projects have helped me with skills like problem solving and teamwork.

                <h3>AI Inovation Project</h3>
                <p>This is a team project done in React that uses AI to help students on the ISU canvas page. This a
                    chrome extension that appears in the form of a sidebar that can be collapsed which allows users
                    to interact with an AI chatbot to clear up any questions about general logistics of a course.
                    The sidebar also generates a list of upcoming assignments so it can be an easy reminder to keep
                    students from forgeting to complete an assignment. There are also a few buttons that serve
                    certain functionalities which are currently undecided.

                <h3>Bingo</h3>
                <p>This is a project done in Java. This is an object-oriented approach for coding the game Bingo.
                    Constructors were used to create the bingo board itself as well as the squares. There are
                    different categories that can be used for the bingo. These categories are organized in a class
                    hierarchy.
